                    <h2>Mitake Ran 美竹 蘭</h2>
                    <h3>Position: Vocals, rhythm guitar</h3>
                    <p>Mitake Ran is a second-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of Afterglow. She is the only child of the masters of a flower arrangement school that dates back to over 100 years ago, and which her father currently owns. She and Yukina (lead vocalist of Roesila) consider each other rivals.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>She is strong-willed and hates losing, and is the type of person to treasure her childhood friends and family deeply. </p>
                    <p>Ran has an aloof nature, which hides her loneliness from other people. Deep down, she wishes to become closer to others, but can be socially awkward and has a tendency to trip over her words. She can be easily flustered and is somewhat hot-blooded. Ran keeps her problems to herself and brushes off help from others, but while she may appear cold or detached, the warmer side to her is best seen in her quiet fondness towards her friends, primarily the other members of Afterglow. Ran observes the other members while remaining unobtrusive and cares for them greatly; she often asks about their well-being or laughs at their jokes, albeit subtly.</p>

                        <h2>Aoba Moca 青葉 モカ</h2>
                        <p><b>Position: Guitarist</b></p>
                        <P>Aoba Moca is a second-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the lead guitarist of Afterglow. She has a sleepy demeanor and speaks with a slow, monotone voice, but is surprisingly sly at times. Although everyone in Afterglow are childhood friends, she is particularly close to Ran. Outside of the band, she's friends with Saaya (drummer of Poppin’Party). She is also friends with Lisa (bassist of Roesila), whom she works part-time with at the same convenience store.</P>
                        <h3>Personality</h3>
                        <p>Moca is playful and often teases others to the point of having to be told by others to stop. Being fairly confident and sure of herself, she often showcases and comments on her own charms, passing off things like having breadcrumbs on her face as "part of her cuteness". Though while relaxed in most cases, her worries make her transparent. She also has a tendency to say non-sequiturs.</p>
                        <p>Despite her playful front, Moca is actually afraid of changes and conflict, especially ones related to the other Afterglow members, and has called herself a coward multiple times due to this. This is side of hers is especially shown in Afterglow's Second Band Story and the event Separate Paths Under One Sky where she is afraid of not being able to keep up with Ran anymore after the latter started participating more in flower arranging.</p>

                    <h2>Uehara Himari 上原 ひまり</h2>
                    <p><b>Position: Leader, bassist</b></p>
                    <p>Uehara Himari is a second-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the leader and bassist of Afterglow. She is a huge fan of Kaoru (guitarist of Hello Happy World!). Outside of the band, she is friends with Rimi (bassist of Poppin’Party) and Lisa, and also works part-time at the fast food restaurant together with Tomoe.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Himari is cheerful and good-natured and is the band's coordinator. She sometimes struggles to read the mood of a situation, and as a result she occasionally does things that have no effect. She's weak to tearjerkers and sentimental episodes, and is fairly romantic. She is also weak to being teased and tends to be clumsy at times.</p>
                    <p>She enjoys comparing the different sweets she buys from convenience stores and likes making them as well. She also likes cute things such as pretty clothing and stuffed animals, but wants to be seen as "cool" by others. Her ideas are normally teased or rejected, especially when she tries to get everyone in the band to say her catchphrase (Hey, hey, ooh~!), though her bandmates always try to show support in their own way.</p>

                    <h2>Udagawa Tomoe 宇田川 巴</h2>
                    <p><b>Position: Drummer</b></p>
                    <p>Udagawa Tomoe is a second-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and Afterglow's drummer. She is Ako's (drummer of Roesila) older sister.Tomoe is friends with the adults who work in the shopping district, and often attends the town's festivals to play the taiko drums. Outside of the band, she is friends with Saaya and also works part-time at the fast food restaurant together with Himari.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Tomoe is a fairly relaxed person, who never says anything bad about other people or holds grudges against them. She keeps the band from falling apart and is idolized for her cool, but mature way of handling things. Despite her mature, punk look, she is very caring towards others and is always there to lend support or a shoulder to cry on. While she is unable to understand Ako's behavior at times, she loves her sister and supports her no matter what.</p>
                    <p>She is also shown to be hotblooded and the type to rush into things head-first if she thinks someone she cares for has been hurt. This has a tendency to backfire on her at times. Adding to this, Tomoe is also capable of sharing the same mental wavelength as Kasumi and Kokoro, something that has shocked other characters.</p>

                    <p><b>Position: Keyboardist</b></p>
                    <p>Hazawa Tsugumi is a second-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and Afterglow's keyboardist. She is also the vice president of Haneoka's student council. She is often called "Tsugu" by her friends. She helps out at her family's cafe, which Eve (keytarist of Pastle Palettes) and Tsukushi (drummer of Morfonica) also work at.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Tsugumi views herself as the most normal girl in the band. She is a very hardworking and optimistic person who rarely gets discouraged, and her optimism buoys the other members' spirits. However, she can easily get flustered and tends to panic when dealing with new people. She is humble almost to a fault, as her modesty often leads her to downplay her own achievements and have difficulty being confident in her skills. She pushes the band to try different challenges, such as entering the Girls Jam concert event,[1] and was even the one to suggest that the girls start a band in the first place.[2]</p>
