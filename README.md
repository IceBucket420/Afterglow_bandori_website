# An OFFICAL Website for AFTERGLOW
## About

 This project is about making a website for a fictional band called Afterglow, a japanese rock-pop band with 5 members from a popular anime series, Bandori(BanG! Dream). 
 This website will contain all the information about the memebers and the band, audio or videos performances from the band, and publicising the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties. Moreover, it will provide links to external resources, such as the band's social medias, game and merchandise.


## Design Process

Essentially, the website is also for the "fans" of the band to learn more about the band's background and the band members, and possibly book them for shows. Additionally, have more fans buy some of their merchandise, music and booking them for gigs. Through this website more fans will have the access to Afterglow content and merchandise, this will help spread the popularity of Afterglow and get more new fans.

User stories:
- As a fan, I want to attend a show of Afterglow, so that I can expeirence their music in person.
- As a fan, I wish to get some of their new albums, so that I can support their music.
- As new fan, I want to know more about the band, so that I can learn about each members history.
